This project looks at the perceptions of local crime in Scotland, using the Scottish Justice and Crime survey which asks a range of questions to Scottish residents around policing, crime and justice nationally and locally. 
Using statistical testing such as linear and ordinal regression analyses, and some visualizations to unpick the data we are working with.

We wanted to test whether, despite people often having positive perceptions of crime locally, does this stand for ethnic minorities within Scotland?

Given that the wider literature demonstrates that ethnic minorities have strained relationships with the police, higher levels of deprivation, higher likelihood to be victims of crime, and reluctance to report certain types of crime,
they would seem to have reason to think that crime rates, locally, are increasing, or have more negativity to how crime is dealt with, impacting their perception of local crime rates.

I used the RMarkdown feature within R to present and analyse the data in this project. Attached is the raw Rmarkdown code, and then the PDF of the final product. 

I found that ethnic minorities were not more likely to feel negatively about local perceptions of crime, generally they felt positively, in line with general trends.
